# SC1015-Mini-Project

## About
This is our mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence), which is a movie recommendation system built from the Rotten Tomatoes Movie dataset obtained from Kaggle.

## Motivation
Many of us have been stuck at home due to the covid-19 pandemic, so here's a simple movie recommendation system to find movies that are similar to those you have enjoyed watching

## Problem Definition
How can we find movies that are similar to those we enjoyed watching?

## Models Used
1. TF-IDF Vectorizer
2. Count Vectorizer

## What have we learned?
1. Simple Natural Language Processing, turning text into numbers for comparison
2. There are many variables which we can be used to recommend movies (description, authors, actors, directors and many more)

## Dataset used from Kaggle
